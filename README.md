Geo Bookmark is a homescreen widget and a dashclock extension that allows you to quickly record your current
whereabouts for later review with a single button press. Some use cases include:

<b>Use case:</b> You are driving down the road, something catches your attention, but you cannot pull over to 
investigate and you cannot savely text yourself a reminder.
<br>
<b>Use case:</b> You work "door to door" (e.g. pizza delivery, bike courier) and want to log your route.
<br>
<b>Use case:</b> You are on vacation and you want to mark a tourist attraction, a restaurant or a meeting point
for returning to later.

Bookmarks are placed on the homescreen. In order to view a bookmark, you need to have a suitable maps application
installed  as well (e.g. Google Maps or OSMAnd~). Please note that in order to conserve battery life, Geo Bookmark 
will only try to get a location when you request it. GPS will be tried first. If no fix can be determined within
40 seconds, the system will be asked if there is a "last known position". On a recently booted device, it may be
nescessary to initialize the location service with a more patient location tracking app.

Bookmarks are color coded. A blue symbol indicates a GPS derived location. A red symbol indicates that the "last
known position" was used and the bookmark should be double checked.
