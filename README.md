Geo Bookmark is a simple widget that will add a bookmark with your current time and geographical location to the homescreen. The interface is kept minimal to allow operation in situations that do not permit extensive interaction with the phone (e.g. while driving a car).

Bookmarks are color coded. Blue icons represent exact locations, red icons mean that the widget could not get a GPS fix within 40 seconds and therefore recorded the last known GPS location.

In order to view a bookmark, a suitable maps application needs to be installed (e.g. Google Maps or OSMAnd).
